 # Our Codex Sandbox Journey: Chapter 2
 > “Search, fix, send — our second chapter unfolds... ”

 In this chapter, we hunted down glitches, bolstered our tests, and got mail flowing end‑to‑end:

 1. Fixed the **search‑bing** skill
    - Discovered that without a local `fetch`, the script was silently returning no results.
    - Pulled in `node‑fetch@3` via **use‑m**, replaced calls to global `fetch` with the imported `fetchFn`.
    - Added a dedicated tape test (`tests/search-bing.mjs`) to verify exit code, output file creation, and correct header.

 2. Diagnosed the **send‑mail** skill
    - Initial SMTP send was failing with `ENOTFOUND smtp.mail.tm` then `ECONNREFUSED` on port 587.
    - Used our **search‑bing** skill and MX lookup on the test domain to uncover the real mail exchanger: `in.mail.tm` on port 25.
    - Patched `skills/send-mail.mjs` to use `host: 'in.mail.tm'` and `port: 25` in the Nodemailer transporter.

 3. Verified end‑to‑end mail flow
    - Manual sends now succeed and write a JSON result.
    - Updated tests (`tests/send-mail.mjs`) pass through register → send → check, confirming real messages arriving in `check-mail/`.

 With search‑bing solid and mail sending restored, our toolkit just got more robust. Onward to the next skill!
