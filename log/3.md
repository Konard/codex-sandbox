# Our Codex Sandbox Journey: Chapter 3
> “One code, two faces – the CLI meets the API.”

In this chapter we gave every **skill** a dual identity – still runnable from the
command line, yet now importable and reusable as plain functions inside other
Node scripts and tests.

## 1  Refactoring the skills

• **Wrapped core logic in exported async functions**
  – `searchBing`, `download`, `checkMail`, `registerEmail`, `sendMail`.
• **Introduced a tiny *isCLI* detector** in each file, so:
  – `node skills/xyz.mjs ...` executes as before,
  – `const { xyz } = await import('./skills/xyz.mjs');` just gives you the
    function with no side‑effects.
• Preserved the dynamic‑dependency pattern (use‑m) – the only code that moved
  was side‑effectful IO wrapped behind the exported functions.

## 2  search‑bing as the template

`skills/search-bing.mjs` was fully modernised first and served as the blueprint
for the other four scripts.  Function returns `{ results, outputFile }` so tests
can introspect without touching the filesystem.

## 3  Extended test coverage

• Added a second phase to `tests/search-bing.mjs` that:
  1. `await import('../skills/search-bing.mjs')`
  2. Confirms the function export exists.
  3. Executes the function, inspects the returned data **and** verifies the
     Markdown file appears.

All previous assertions remain, giving us confidence both entry points behave
identically.

## 4  Green board

Both test suites now pass:

```bash
$ node tests/search-bing.mjs   # 8/8 ok
$ node tests/send-mail.mjs     # 6/6 ok
```

With this dual‑use foundation laid, future projects can script against our
skills library without ever spawning child‑processes, while casual users still
enjoy the convenience of simple CLI tools.  Two faces, one code‑base – the
journey continues!
