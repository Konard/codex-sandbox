# Our Codex Sandbox Journey: Chapter 1
> "Every script tells a story..."

It all started with a simple idea: build self-contained, portable Node.js tools that never clutter a project with `node_modules` or `package.json`. Over the course of this adventure, here’s what we’ve forged:

1. **Download Script**
   - Crafted `download.mjs` under `skills/`.
   - Used top-level `await` and ES Modules for clarity.
   - Dynamically loaded dependencies (`node-fetch`, `fs-extra`) via **use-m**.
   - Slugified arbitrary URLs into safe filenames.
   - Defaulted output into an ignored `download/` folder, with optional custom paths.

2. **Search-Bing Tool**
   - Built `search-bing.mjs` to scrape Bing search results.
   - Imported **cheerio** at runtime via **use-m** for HTML parsing.
   - Tamed query strings into slug filenames under `search-bing/`.
   - Generated Markdown lists of results automatically.

3. **Repository Sculpting**
   - Removed stray `*.md` and `*.html` from root.
   - Added `.gitignore` entries for `download/` and `search-bing/`.
   - Synced our sandbox with a remote GitHub repo.
   - Moved scripts into a dedicated `skills/` folder for clarity.

4. **Documentation & Conventions**
   - Created a `README.md` to capture our conventions:
     - ES Modules with top-level `await`.
     - **use-m** for dynamic imports.
     - Default output folders named after scripts.
   - Detailed usage examples and guidelines for future skills.

With folders laid out and stories recorded, our sandbox stands ready: a living workshop of dynamic Node.js skills. The next chapters await new tools, new conventions, and new adventures—this is just the beginning!
