# Our Codex Sandbox Journey: Chapter 4
> “Encrypt first, authenticate always — our mail gets a security upgrade.”

In this chapter we hardened the **send-mail** skill by enforcing encrypted SMTP transport via STARTTLS:

1. Documented Mail.tm SMTP details
   - Crafted a note that all Mail.tm domains’ MX records point to `in.mail.tm` on port 25
   - Explained that submission ports 465 and 587 are unreachable, requiring STARTTLS negotiation

2. Enforced TLS in the transporter
   - Kept `secure: false` to initiate a plain connection
   - Added `requireTLS: true` so Nodemailer always upgrades to an encrypted channel
   - Annotated the configuration with comments detailing the SMTP setup

With this update, every outgoing message now travels over a secure, encrypted link — no more cleartext fallbacks.
